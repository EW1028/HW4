In Mini Game 4, it uses the model view controller pattern to keep the player code decoupled from other systems such as scoring and audio. The model aspect is minimal in this assignment, so the focus is on the control and view components. The control side of model view controller is defined by the GameController class. GameController manages the core game logic and state, including IsPlaying, the player's score(score), and game flow through methods such as StartGame(), AddPoint(), GameOver(), and PlayerFlap(). Instead of directly controlling UI or audio, GameController commmunicates changes using events like OnScoreChanged, OnPointScored, OnplayerFlap, and OnGameOver. the view side of model view controller is defined by classes that present feedback to the player. The Score class acts as a UI view by subscribing to OnScoreChanged and updating the TMP _Text in HandleScoreChanged(int score). The AudioManager class is also a view component, it subscribles to OnPlayerFlap, OnPointScored, and OnPlayerFlap, OnPointScored, and OnGameOver in OnEnable() and plays the appropriate sounds using audioSource.PlayOneShot(). Events are used to keep the control and view layer to be decouple. For example, when the player jumps, Player.Jump() calls GameController.Instance.PlayerFlap(), which triggers the OnPlayerFlap event. AudioManager responds bby playing a sound, without the Player needing any reference to the audio system. A Singleton is used in the GameController through the static Instance property to ensure there is only one controller managing the game. Other classes such as Player, Score, PipeSpawner, and ScoreZone access the controller through GameController.Instance without direct dependencies. This combination of events and a Singleton keeps the system modular and the Player code can be look clean and decoupled.
